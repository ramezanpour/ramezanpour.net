    <h1>Mohammad M. Ramezanpour</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome! I'm a Software developer since 2002, husband since
      2012, and father since 2017. Also a bookworm, math lover, and physics
      enthusiast. I kept this website alive since 2008 although most of my posts
      were lost due to my own laziness. I made tons of mistakes, failed so much
      I can't remember the amount, and wasted a lot of time; but, I did my best
      to learn from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently hooked by Golang, Python, and C. *nix terminal is my home
      and
      <a href="https://neovim.io/" target="_blank">Neovim</a> is my text editor
      of choice.
