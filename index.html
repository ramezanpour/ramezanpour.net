    <h1>Mohammad M. Ramezanpour</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and Welcome! My name is Mohammad and I am a Software developer since
      2002, husband since 2012, and father since 2017. Also a bookworm, math
      lover, and physics enthusiast. I use this website write about my
      experiences and new things that I learn through my life. I made tons of
      mistakes, failed so much I can't remember the amount, and wasted a lot of
      time; but, I did my best to learn from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, my focus is around Python, Golang, the C programming language,
      and people management.
