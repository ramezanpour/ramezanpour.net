Welcome! On this page, you’ll find more information about who I am, my areas of expertise, and a summary of my work
experience.

I was born in the 1980s in Tehran, the capital of Iran. The first computer our family owned was a bulky PC tower powered
by an Intel Pentium 200MHz MMX CPU, with 32MB of RAM, a 2.1GB hard drive, a 2MB S3 graphics card (no 3D support!), and
an OPTi 931 sound card.

At the time, MS-DOS was the primary operating system, though we could also run Windows 3.1 — a graphical shell rather
than a full OS, since it lacked a bootloader. I mainly used the PC for gaming and listening to music, while my older
sister, who had actually bought the machine, used it for drafting construction plans in AutoCAD.

My first taste of programming came during high school, when I visited a relative studying at Sharif University of
Technology. He introduced me to QBasic, and together we wrote my very first program:

```vb
INT i
FOR i = 1 TO 16
    COLOR i
    PRINT i
NEXT i
END
```

This simple script printed the number `i` in all 16 colors supported by MS-DOS:

At 17, I landed my first engineering job in a small firm in Tehran as a classic ASP developer. Since I was already
familiar with Visual Basic, picking up ASP (which supported `VBScript`) came naturally. Unfortunately, I had to leave
the role after nine months due to being under the legal working age of 18.

Around that time, Microsoft released the .NET framework. I jumped on board right away. With VB.NET being a supported
language, I quickly became comfortable with the platform. After turning 18, I joined another company that built custom
software solutions. During this period, I also learned C#, which was heavily promoted by Microsoft and rapidly growing
in popularity.

I spent nearly a decade working as a .NET developer before realizing I needed a new challenge. I explored C and C++,
building small personal projects, but breaking into professional C++ development proved to be a challenge. That’s when I
turned to Python — a language that struck the right balance between practicality and power. Since then, I've been
working full-time as a Python engineer.

Being more than 20 years in the game, I never got tired of programming. When I code, I get the same amount of dopamine
as if I'm playing video games. What I realised is that, to be successful in _any_ career, one should love the work so
much that they don't get tried easily. Love is the reason some people can sit for more than 12 hours a day behind a desk
and look at a screen full of text.

Beyond coding, I enjoy reading, running, and playing video games.
