My name is Mohammad Mahdi Ramezanpour. I was born and grown in Tehran, Iran;
but, now live in Berlin, Germany. I have started developing software at the age
of 13 with [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) and then [Visual
Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic). After .NET Framework was
introduced by Microsoft, I migrated all of my projects to .NET and became a
.NET Developer for almost around 10 years.

In 2013 and for a short time, I have also tried mobile application development
and developed 4 iOS applications but TBH I didn't like it.

In 2016, after having been using the Microsoft technology stack for more than a
decade, I decided to try new stacks. As a result, I started learning and using
Python programming language while switching to Linux OS. After maybe 3 months
these became my main stack! I moved completely from Windows to
[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) and developed all of my projects using
Python as the programming language and PostgreSQL as my main database engine of
choice.

My preferred text editors of choice <s>are VSCode and</s> is [neo]vim. I was
using VSCode because vim doesn't provide good support for RTL languages such as
Persian. Feel free to check out my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/ramezanpour/dotfiles) on GitHub.

Last but not least, this blog is proudly powered by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com).
