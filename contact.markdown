First of all, thank you in advance for your interest in contacting me. You might have expected something fancier such as
a contact form here but over the years I realised that when it comes to contact, you should keep it as simple as
possible and when it comes to simplicity, there's nothing simpler than email.

To contact, please use the following email: **i\[at sign\]this domain**.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
