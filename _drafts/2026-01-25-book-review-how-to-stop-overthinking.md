What I realised about myself is that, during weekends, especially when the weather is not good and we have to stay at
home, I get excessively bored and after that my toleration level drops significantly. In some extreme cases, I want to
stay completely alone and I feel that if I am alone I would feel calm however, even if I am alone, I don't feel better.
Instead, I would start thinking about too much about things, sometimes completely irrelevant topics. I didn't know what
this behaviour is called but after reading the How to Stop Overthinking book, I realised that it's actually called
**overthinking**.

Thinking by its nature is very important for humans, it's one of the main behaviours that distinguishes us from other
animals. However, when we overthink, we think too an extent that is _not beneficial for us anymore_.
