Since we moved to Berlin, we were very busy settling in. Creating a new life from scratch is not easy at all. I don't know about other country's regulations; but, one needs at least six months to sort things out in Germany including apartment finding, registering for kindergarten, all the paper works, etc. All in all, it took us more than a year to completely settle in.

## The Eiffel Tower

Without a doubt, the Eiffel tower is the most famous attraction of Paris. It was a very unique moment for us to see the tower with out own eyes for the first time.
