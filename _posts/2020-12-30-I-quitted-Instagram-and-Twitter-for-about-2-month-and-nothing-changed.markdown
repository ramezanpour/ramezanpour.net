I have been using Instagram and Twitter for nearly a decade. After reading
Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport, I decided to practice [using social media in
a more intentional way]({% post_url 2020-10-04-digital-declutter %}) so I
started monitoring all of my social media activities and values they provide.
What I realized was that Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter create almost _no_
values for me at all. It was such a surprise because I put so much effort to _take
care_ of them in the past. For example, I tried my best to curate almost all of
my tweets, try to post the best photos I could on Instagram; but in fact, I
received almost no values from them.

As a result, I removed all social media apps from my phone and practiced using
them via my computer's web browser instead to reduce the amount of time I spend
on each service. I also tweeted a few and posted a couple photos on Instagram
since that time but again, I received no values in return! Finally I made my
choice and signed out from my accounts even from web browsers. I wanted to see
if not using these social media services have effects on my life and the
results was a big NO! After quitting Twitter and Instagram nothing changed. I
still in touch with my friends and family via Whatsapp and if I want to share a
photo with them, I just post it to our family groups.

To be able to stay tuned with the latest news I care about, I installed an RSS
reader on my computer and subscribed to my favorites websites and blogs and I
usually check them once every other day.

It's important to understand that by using social media, you're spending your
**time** and companies behind those services are selling your time to other
companies like advertisers. They make _a lot_ of money out of your attention and
I believe it's important for everyone to understand what is going on behind the
scenes. I highly recommend you to reconsider your social media consumption and
decide how you want your time to be spent because all creatures only live once.
