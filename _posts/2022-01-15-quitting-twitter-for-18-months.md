I think I was one of the firsts among software engineers who started using
Twitter in Iran back in 2007-2008; however, I am not proud of it at all. What
makes me proud is that I was able to quit it 18 months ago! Also, I didn't
limit my self to just Twitter, and I also quit Facebook. Having said that, now
the only social network that I am partially active in is Instagram which I have
planned to get rid of soon.

What I have experienced during the these 18 months is that, the advantages of
Twitter and other social networks are radically less than their disadvantages.
I think we are spending our most valuable thing, which is time, making money
for social network companies while we don't get too much of them. Even if you
follow, Nasa, MIT, or your favorite music band doesn't mean that your time is
spent meaningfully.

But one may ask, I use social networks to stay informed about topics I like! If
I quit Twitter for example, how can I keep posted about my favorite soccer
club? My approach is to be as specific as possible. For instance, I like
astronomy. To be able to stay informed about the latest news and stories, I
have signed up for a weekly newsletter called [The Space
Review](https://www.thespacereview.com). Every Tuesday, I get the top most
important and trending stories about space directly in my inbox. Tech and
programming are another examples, I check hackernews twice a week and also
subscribed to ArchLinux mailing list.

This approach works for me but it may not work for you. But the good point here
is that you have control over your time and that's the important part.
