As you may know, I am a big fan of science especially when it comes to physics and more specifically astrophysics. A few weeks back I was watching a video about science on YouTube and suddenly a video in the side column got my attention.

It was a video from [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), the famous physicist, in which the interviewer asks him a very simple yet valid question about magnets. The question is about why something happens and Feynman answer is very interesting. I don't want to spoil it so please take a moment and watch this ~7 minutes video:
