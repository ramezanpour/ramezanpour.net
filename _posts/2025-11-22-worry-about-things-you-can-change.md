News websites — and certain people — can make you worry about everything. The moment you open a news site or talk to
them, you start feeling anxious about things far outside your control. Whether it’s new workplace rules or world events,
many of these _sources of information_ are unhelpful, if not harmful.

Of course, you can try to avoid such news or people. But there are three fundamental questions you can ask whenever
you’re confronted with worrying information:

- **Can I change it?**
- **Can I influence it?**
- **Can I control it?**

This idea comes from the classic book
_[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People)_,
where the author presents the famous **Circle of Control** framework:

Stephen Covey explains that there are many things in life we care about — politics, the economy, other people’s
behavior, global events — but most of these lie outside our direct control. We might influence some of them slightly,
but we cannot change them directly.

Covey also argues that **the more time you spend worrying about things outside your control — like constantly checking
the news — the more your _Circle of Influence_ shrinks.** Your attention gets pulled into areas where you have no power,
leaving you with less energy, confidence, and focus for the things you _can_ actually impact.

Covey’s main point is simple: **We should not invest our time and energy in things we cannot influence or control.**

> Think less about things you cannot change, and more about things you _can_ change or influence.

So, the next time you encounter bad news or a stressful situation, ask yourself:

- **Can I control this?**
- **Can I influence it at all?**

If the answer to either question is “yes,” then it’s worth your time and energy. If not, then it's healthier to let it
go and refocus on the things you _can_ change — for example:

- Your health
- Your skills
- Your family
- Your mindset
