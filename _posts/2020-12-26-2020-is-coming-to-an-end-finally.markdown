2020 will be over in less than 5 days. It was not a good year especially for me. Due to some circumstances, I had no choice but to stay at home. I was supposed to join my new company by June, but because of the pandemic, I had no choice but to stay home and WAIT! Believe me or not but waiting and uncertainty are the worst things I have ever experienced.

Although I‚Äôm still waiting and trying to deal with the uncertainty, I did my best to adapt to this situation by taking advantage of it. I learned a lot! There were lots of topics either technical or non-technical that I was interested in learning them but I had not enough time in the past to dig deep. For example, I have started to learn a new language (Ich begann eine neue Sprache lernen üòâ), extended my contribution to more open source communities, dug deep in Go programming language, and more importantly, learned how to work from home. I tried to be the best friend for my wife and a better father for my daughter. I understood that having a good family and relationship is one of the most important things to have.

I know lots of you may have similar situations but as mentioned in the Shawshank Redemption: ‚Äú_Hope is a good thing_‚Äù. I‚Äôm confident that 2021 would be the year of happiness and progress.

Stay safe and happy new year!
