I am not a fast reader (at least by now) and it took me little bit more time than others to read a passage. However, since I don't have anything to do due to this pandemic, reading is the only thing I do.

Two days ago I was privileged to finish [Educated](https://www.amazon.com/Educated/dp/1984854852){:target="blank"} and let me tell you this: it's one of the best books I have ever read. It's not a science-fiction but basically a memoir of its author, Tara Westover. I mentioned science-fiction because at first when I started the book I thought it is! It's full of strange events happening around and I couldn't believe that all of these wired events are happening in the 21st century.

Tara, has never been to school until the age of 17 because her parents believed public schools wash the kids minds so they keep their children at home as much as possible. To avoid schools they didn't get birth certificates for some of their children. Tara has received hers at the age of 9!

In addition, Tara's parents didn't believe on hospitals as well! They thought human made (chemical) drugs will rot patients' bodies from inside and they will kill them. So when her mother's head injured badly during a car accident, her father took mother to home instead of hospital!

In some developing countries these kind of believes still exist. a small amount of

But Tara found her own way toward being _Educated_, she attended in a collage and started her new path of life until she awarded with PhD from Cambridge!

As a matter of fact, I want to talk about this book for days to reflect how fascinating it was, but at the same time, don't want to spoil it.

I think this book is the one of those everyone should have at their bookshelves; so, go ahead and either purchase it online or from your local bookstore.
