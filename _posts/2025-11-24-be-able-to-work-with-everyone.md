Technical capabilities are important for any competent engineer or engineering manager. With strong technical skills,
you can solve problems faster and stay on top of complex topics.

But being a manager is ultimately about soft skills: managing humans, resolving conflicts within a team, and providing
growth opportunities.

One soft skill that people often underestimate is the ability to work effectively with different functions — especially
with product managers. A strong engineering manager should not only work well with a highly skilled, experienced PM;
they should also be able to collaborate productively with a junior, inconsistent, or less mature PM.

This adaptability is what separates effective managers from the rest. You don’t get to choose the skill level of your
counterparts, but you can choose how well you work with them.

**Cross-functional collaboration** isn’t just a nice-to-have. It’s a core leadership skill. The more you can adapt your
communication, expectations, and style to any product manager — regardless of their strengths or weaknesses — the more
effective and productive your team will be.
