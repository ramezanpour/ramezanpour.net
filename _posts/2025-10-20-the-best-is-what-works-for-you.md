If you open YouTube, Instagram, or any other social network, you’ll notice countless posts comparing things — trying to decide which one is “the best.” You’ll see titles like “AirPods Killer,” “Garmin vs. Apple Watch,” or “The Best Gaming Laptop.”

But here’s the truth: none of these really matter, because your life is probably very different from the person who created those posts.

People have different expectations and needs. For one person, a simple non-smart watch might be perfect. For another — say, an ultra runner — a smartwatch with long battery life and advanced tracking might be essential.

The sad part is that many of these videos are not created to help you. Their real goal is to keep you watching — because that’s how their creators get paid.

So, instead of asking “Which one is the best?”, maybe we should ask: “Which one works best for me?”

The best one is always the one that fits your life — not someone else’s.
