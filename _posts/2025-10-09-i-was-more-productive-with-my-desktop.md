Last week I wrote about the fact that people were more productive when we moved from [wired connections to wireless]({% post_url 2025-10-06-when-life-was-wired-and-we-were-happier %}).

Besides the distraction that wireless devices can create, being wired has other implications:

- When you're wired, you have a specific location for doing something.
- When you're wired, there’s no sitting on the sofa with your laptop while watching TV.
- When you're wired, you can’t take your phone or tablet to bed — which ultimately leads to better sleep.
- When you're wired, you need to move more throughout the day to get your day-to-day stuff done, which helps you burn more calories and stay more active.

When you read productivity books, they all emphasize that to be productive, one should focus on a few key things:

- Focus on one thing at a time —> from “Deep Work” by Cal Newport
- Avoid distractions —> from “Indistractable” by Nir Eyal
- Get a good amount of sleep —> from “Why We Sleep” by Matthew Walker
- Be more active throughout the day —? from “Atomic Habits” by James Clear

You see, just by being wired, one can naturally live a better, more productive life.

I was talking with my wife the other day and told her I was way more productive when I had a desktop PC. When I think about it, my current laptop is far more powerful than my old PC, but simply because I was **wired**, I was able to achieve more when I used it.
