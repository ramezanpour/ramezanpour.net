If you have your own domain and website, you probably want to have some _@yourdomain_ emails as well. Although some hosting providers offer free email hosting, some simply don't. You also have to configure your own mail server if you're owning a VPN or dedicated server.

If you're setting up a mail server for your company, there are some premium mail providers available such as Microsoft Office 365 and GSuite that offer huge amount of features such as online storage, document editing features and so on. On the other hand, people like me may just need to have an email address on their own domain. They need a good email server but don't want the extra featured which I have mentioned a couple of them few lines above. At this point you want to give Zoho Mail a try.

Zoho Mail is an email hosting service is offers just I wanted. All you need to do is to sign up. They guide you through the process of setting things up and then you will have the access to your new inbox. The free plan offers up to 5 users for free. This free plan gives you full access to their web panel and well as Zoho Mail app so you can check your email either on you phone or your computer. However, if you need `IMAP` or `POP` access, you need to upgrade to a premium plan as low as \$1 per month.
