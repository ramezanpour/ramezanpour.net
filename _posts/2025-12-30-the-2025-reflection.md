2026 is just around the corner. Looking back at 2025, it was a year of big changes for me. Having moved to Germany
almost five years ago, I finally felt more integrated. We tried to become part of society, learn the German language,
make German friends, and—most importantly—not remain neutral.

That last part matters a lot to me. I don’t like being passive. When I live in a society, I want to contribute to it. I
tried. I wasn’t successful all the time, but at least I did what I could.

2025 was a year of mixed feelings. On the one hand, I became more independent—both at work and in my personal life. On
the other hand, being on my own was tough. I had to make decisions without the support I previously relied on. I took on
responsibilities that, from the outside, looked scary. I committed to things I wouldn’t have committed to before.

I put a lot of pressure on myself this past year. Toward the end of it, I realized something important: when I give
priority to too many things, nothing gets the _actual_ priority it deserves. In other words, [when everything is
important, nothing matters]({% post_url 2025-12-16-when-everything-is-important-nothing-is %}).

Instead of constantly trying to achieve more, I’m learning to focus on what I already have. In 2026, I want to focus on
things that are actually important—especially those I can influence—rather than spending energy on topics I have no
control over. Basically, [to worry about things I can have influence
on]({% post_url 2025-11-22-worry-about-things-you-can-change %}).

2026 is going to be exciting, and I want to embrace it. We can’t say for sure what the future holds, but we _can_ say
that our actions play an important role in shaping it.
