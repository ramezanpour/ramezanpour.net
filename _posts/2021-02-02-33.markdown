Today was my 33rd birthday. Although it's getting more and more boring for some people to celebrate birthdays, it's going to be a special year for me.

Last year I decided to start a new path in my life and moving from the city I've born in to another country. Although I'm still here in Tehran, I've almost done doing whatever needed to move.

The reason I'm mentioning this is because this move is not only valuable for me but for my wife and my daughter as well. It will open new doors in our lives and as a father and husband, I'll do whatever needed to provide the best life quality possible for my family. Because as a matter of fact, there is nothing more important than our families.

I hope everything goes fine and the process finishes in a smooth way.
